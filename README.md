A 5x3 split keyboard with 3 thumbs. There is nothing unique about the keyboard layout. It's inspired by Corne and Kyria, and
has the exact number of keys needed for the [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) layout.

The interesting thing about this keyboard is that it's a declarative design
* Layout is declared using [Ergogen](https://github.com/mrzealot/ergogen/)
* The build system uses Ergogen to translate YAML to a KiCad PCB and plate files for FR2 fab or laser cutting
  * TODO pull out these files from the `output` folder and move them to some other target
* uses [kicad-automation-scripts](https://github.com/productize/kicad-automation-scripts) and [FreeRouting](https://github.com/freerouting/freerouting) to **automatically route the traces on the PCB**
* uses [KiKit](https://github.com/yaqwsx/KiKit) to render PCB previews (see top of this file) and production-ready **Gerber files**

See the [Makefile](Makefile) for more details.
